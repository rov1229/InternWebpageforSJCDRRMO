                <p>The San Juan City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CDRRMO) has demonstrated a steadfast

                    integrating disaster risk strategies into the health system.</p>

                <p>In December 2022, San Juan City received recognition for its compliance with disaster risk reduction and 
                    management standards, achieving a score of 1.87. The award was accepted by CDRRMO Department Head Saripada 
                    “Tong” L. Pacasum Jr.</p>
